# ðŸ¤– Classification Algorithms Implementations
This repository provides Python implementations of foundational machine learning algorithms developed as part of the Machine Learning (20942) course. It includes:
* The **Perceptron Algorithm** and the **Pocket Algorithm**, designed to handle both linearly separable and inseparable data.
* A multiclass extension of the **Pocket Algorithm using the One-Versus-All** strategy, where multiple binary classifiers are trained to distinguish each class from the rest.
* A **Softmax Regression** implementation, suitable for multiclass classification tasks.
* A **digit classification** system built on Softmax Regression, demonstrating its application on real-world multiclass data such as handwritten digits.
